- **🤝 People Person**: I’ve learned that the most rewarding part of my work isn’t just solving technical problems but building connections—whether it’s with clients, teammates, or my favorite barista.  

## 🔧 My Skill Set
- **Embedded Systems**: From coding microcontrollers in C to designing with Matlab Simulink.  
- **HIL Testing**: Using NI PXI series to build the test environments.  
- **Wireless Communication**: Bluetooth, CAN Bus, and more.  
- **Languages**:  
  - 🇹🇼 Chinese (Native)  
  - 🇬🇧 English (Fluent)  
  - 🇩🇪 German (Begineer, working on it!)  

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On
